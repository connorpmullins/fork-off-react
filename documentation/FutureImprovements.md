# Potential Future Improvements

### Pre-populating a story with JSON from an older one

- Are there any concerns with people creating explicit or otherwise problematic JSON?

### Generating Public Links for Stories

- Allow players to generate public links to stories after playing so others can view them.

### Community Stories

- Would seeing community-created stories add value?

### Export and Sharing

- **Export Options**:

  - Players can export the completed story and its tree structure as JSON.

- **Story Viewer**:
  - A dedicated page to upload JSON files and visualize or explore story trees.

### Advanced Game Modes

- Add competitive scoring or role-based storytelling.

## Image Support

- Generate an image for each fork.

## Additional Configuration

- Configure the "voice" of the AI story-teller to match a genre
- horror, comedy, slice of life, surreal, tragedy, love story, etc..
- Don't know if we need to be prescriptive here, but it could just be part of the prompt that the AI responds in the pre-set voice each fork
